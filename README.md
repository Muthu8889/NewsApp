2.	Must add .gitignore file in your repository to avoid uploading any compiled/ third party binaries.
3.	Must define the steps in README file to reproduce the images used for docker.
4.	Must add your Mentor as developer in your repository.
7.	Use port number 8081 for API and 8089 for Authentication layer.
8.	Code must be appropriately/descriptively commented in all layers.
9.	Error/exception handling must be done to make it user friendly. There should not be any console logs in your application.
